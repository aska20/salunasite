   <div class="photo-card">
    <img src="family.jpg" alt="Family Memory">
    <div class="photo-text">
        No matter how far you are now, your family must miss you deeply. 
        You have always been such a loving and understanding daughter 
        someone who carries her family’s values with pride. 
        Even in the UK, I know your heart still stays connected to home.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="brother.jpg" alt="Sibling Bond">
    <div class="photo-text">
        The bond you share with your brother is something truly special. 
        The teasing, the laughter, the silent understanding 
        it’s a connection that only siblings can have.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="holi.jpg" alt="Our Friendship">
    <div class="photo-text">
        From class 7–8 until now, it has been such a long journey of friendship. 
        We have grown, changed, and stepped into different phases of life, 
        but our bond has only become stronger with time.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="motivate.jpg" alt="After Accident">
    <div class="photo-text">
        This was the first photo I took after my accident. 
        I felt broken, insecure, and unsure if I could ever be myself again. 
        But you were the one who kept motivating me pushing me gently 
        out of that insecure zone and helping me rebuild my confidence.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="newari.jpg" alt="Newari Culture">
    <div class="photo-text">
        Seeing you dressed in Newari culture makes me feel proud. 
        The tradition, the grace, the heritage  you carry it so beautifully, 
        like you were born to represent it.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="cake.jpg" alt="Cake Moments">
    <div class="photo-text">
        We never needed a celebration to buy cake. 
        Sometimes we just went out randomly, bought one, 
        and enjoyed it like it was the biggest occasion in the world.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="bhakti.jpg" alt="Tika Photo">
    <div class="photo-text">
        With tika on your forehead, you look so graceful and pure — 
        like a truly dharmik and respectful woman. 
        There’s something so peaceful and beautiful about that look.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="time.jpg" alt="Fun Time">
    <div class="photo-text">
        The two of you laughing your hearts out 
        those carefree moments where life felt light and simple. 
        No worries, no stress  just pure happiness.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="style.jpg" alt="Stylish Photo">
    <div class="photo-text">
        This stylish photo of you standing in that nest-like place 
        you truly look like a little bird, confident and free. 
        It’s one of those pictures where you shine effortlessly.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="maleup.jpg" alt="Makeup Try">
    <div class="photo-text">
        When I tried makeup on you, I realized how naturally beautiful you are. 
        Your facial features are so sharp and perfect 
        you looked absolutely stunning without even trying too hard.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="basanta.jpg" alt="Basantapur Memory">
    <div class="photo-text">
        Our Basantapur day  laughing, roaming around, 
        eating foksu, and enjoying every second. 
        That day felt simple but unforgettable.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="photo-card">
    <img src="last.jpg" alt="Last Meetup">
    <div class="photo-text">
        This was our last meetup before you left for the UK. 
        I miss our bond deeply no one can ever replace 
        the place you hold in my heart. 
        I will always wait for the day we meet again soon.

        <h2>What Our Friendship Means</h2>

        <p>
            We didn’t need big plans, expensive gifts, or perfect days.
            We just needed each other  and somehow, that was enough.
        </p>

        <p>
            From sharing snacks, saving pennies, laughing at silly jokes,
            and dreaming about the future  we grew up side by side.
        </p>

        <p>
            No pretending. No filters. Just pure, chaotic, beautiful friendship.
            And I wouldn’t trade these memories for anything.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for being my constant through every phase of life.
            Childhood friend, partner in crime, and forever safe place. ❤️
